# Daily Memory Journal App with AI Reflection - MVP Action Plan

## Project Overview

This is a **Daily Memory Journal** mobile application with **AI-powered reflection cycles** built with React Native/Expo that allows users to:

### **Core Memory System:**
- Write **one memory per day** (daily journaling)
- Navigate through calendar dates with beautiful week-based interface
- Store memories in a local SQLite database
- **Same-day editing only** - memories can only be edited on the day they were written

### **AI Reflection Cycles:**
- **Weekly Reflection**: Choose 1 "haunting" memory from the week → AI generates uplifting story
- **Monthly Reflection**: Choose 1 memory from 4 weekly selections → AI generates deeper insight
- **Yearly Reflection**: Choose 1 memory from 12 monthly selections → AI generates profound reflection

### **Technical Features:**
- Authenticate users with Clerk
- Beautiful gradient UI with custom fonts and haptic feedback
- AI integration for therapeutic story generation

The app focuses on **personal growth through structured reflection**, using AI to help users reframe difficult experiences into opportunities for healing and growth. **The key constraint is that memories become "locked" after the day passes, preserving the authenticity of thoughts from each specific day.**

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ What's Working
- **Basic App Structure**: Expo/React Native setup with proper navigation
- **UI Components**: Beautiful gradient backgrounds, custom styling, haptic feedback
- **Database Schema**: SQLite with Drizzle ORM for storing user memories
- **Authentication**: Clerk integration for user auth (sign-in component exists)
- **Calendar Navigation**: Week-based date navigation with horizontal scrolling
- **Core UI**: Text input for memories, date display, basic styling

### ❌ Critical Issues to Fix
1. **Missing Sign-Up Component**: Referenced but doesn't exist
2. **Incomplete Authentication Flow**: Auth layout exists but not fully integrated
3. **Database Not Connected to Auth**: Using hardcoded user IDs
4. **Missing Clerk Configuration**: Environment variables and setup
5. **Week View Not Implemented**: Basic placeholder only
6. **AI Reflection System Missing**: Core feature for weekly/monthly/yearly reflections
7. **Reflection Database Schema Missing**: Need tables for storing AI-generated stories
8. **AI Integration Missing**: No AI service integration for story generation
9. **Reflection UI Missing**: No interface for memory selection and story display
10. **Error Handling**: Limited error handling throughout the app

## 🤖 **AI Reflection System - Detailed Concept**

### **The Reflection Cycle:**

```
Daily Memories (7 days) 
    ↓ (End of Week)
Weekly Reflection: "Which memory still haunts you?"
    ↓ (AI generates uplifting story)
Weekly Selection Stored

Monthly Memories (4 weekly selections)
    ↓ (End of Month) 
Monthly Reflection: "Which weekly memory resonates most?"
    ↓ (AI generates deeper insight story)
Monthly Selection Stored

Yearly Memories (12 monthly selections)
    ↓ (End of Year)
Yearly Reflection: "Which monthly memory defines your growth?"
    ↓ (AI generates profound life story)
Yearly Selection Stored
```

### **AI Story Generation Types:**

1. **Weekly Stories**: 
   - **Therapeutic reframing** narratives (200-400 words)
   - Transform difficult memories into growth opportunities
   - Healing-focused perspective shifts with gentle wisdom
   - "What if this challenging moment was actually preparing you for..."

2. **Monthly Stories**: 
   - **Inspirational narratives** with deeper insights (400-600 words)
   - Pattern recognition across weekly selections
   - Motivational themes connecting memories to personal strength
   - "Your journey this month reveals a pattern of resilience..."

3. **Yearly Stories**: 
   - **Transformative life narratives** (600-1000 words)
   - Profound therapeutic and inspirational synthesis
   - Major life philosophy and growth documentation
   - "This year's defining moment illuminates your transformation into..."

**AI Integration: OpenRouter** - Flexible AI model access with therapeutic prompt engineering

### **Memory Selection Approach:**

**Intelligent Curation System**:
- Present user with their **top 3-5 "haunting" memories** from the period
- AI pre-analysis identifies emotionally significant entries based on:
  - Emotional intensity keywords and sentiment
  - Memory length and detail richness
  - User writing patterns indicating importance
- User makes final selection from curated options
- **Backup**: If insufficient memories exist, user can select from all available memories
- **Future Enhancement**: Machine learning to improve curation based on user selection patterns

### **Design Decisions (Clarified):**

1. **"Haunting" Memory Definition**: 
   - **Most emotionally impactful memories** that stick in your mind
   - Can be positive, negative, or complex experiences
   - Memories that feel significant or transformative
   - Those that keep returning to consciousness

2. **AI Tone & Style**:
   - **Primary**: Therapeutic reframing with gentle wisdom
   - **Secondary**: Inspirational and empowering perspective
   - **Voice**: Supportive therapist + wise friend hybrid
   - **Approach**: Growth-oriented, not dismissive of pain

3. **Story Length & Depth**:
   - **Weekly**: 200-400 words (therapeutic reframe)
   - **Monthly**: 400-600 words (inspirational insights)
   - **Yearly**: 600-1000 words (life transformation narrative)

4. **Memory Curation**:
   - AI-assisted selection of 3-5 most significant memories
   - User makes final choice from curated options
   - Fallback to manual selection if needed

5. **Story Content Focus**:
   - **Primary**: Therapeutic reframing of difficult experiences as growth opportunities
   - **Secondary**: Finding hidden lessons and deeper meaning in experiences
   - **Tertiary**: Connecting individual memories to larger life themes and patterns
   - **Outcome**: Practical wisdom and gentle guidance for continued healing

6. **Timing & Triggers**:
   - **Automatic prompts**: Sunday evening (weekly), last day of month (monthly), December 31st (yearly)
   - **User-initiated**: Available anytime through reflection menu
   - **Smart reminders**: Gentle notifications with option to skip or postpone
   - **Flexible scheduling**: User can adjust timing preferences

7. **Storage & Persistence**:
   - **Local SQLite**: All AI stories stored locally for offline access
   - **Reflection history**: Complete archive of past AI-generated stories
   - **Export capability**: Stories can be exported as text/PDF for external storage
   - **Search functionality**: Full-text search through reflection archive

### **OpenRouter Integration Specifications:**

- **Model Selection**: Primary Claude-3.5-Sonnet for therapeutic tone, fallback to GPT-4
- **Prompt Engineering**: Specialized prompts for each reflection type (weekly/monthly/yearly)
- **Token Management**: Optimized for cost-effective story generation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and retry logic for API failures
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect API limits with appropriate delays and queuing

*This plan prioritizes the revolutionary AI reflection system that transforms a simple journal into a powerful tool for personal growth and healing.*
